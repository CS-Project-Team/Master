Master
======

This is the Master Repo, once we have the code tested in our enviornment we'll pull it into this branch.


Steps To merge your code into the Master branch

1) Install Git from your terminal
2) Create a new folder for our project
3) Clone the repo using git clone https://github.com/CS-Project-Team/Master.git in the project directory
4) Create a subdrectory for your specific code (Eg. PA1)
5) Inside the subdirectory, create a new branch: git checkout -b 'your branch name'
6) Add your files into this subdirectory
7) Add the file to the git stash: git add -A
8) Commit your changes with your message: git commit -m 'Your Message'
9) Push the changes to Github: git push origin 'your branch name'
10)See the changes online.

Happy Coding :)
